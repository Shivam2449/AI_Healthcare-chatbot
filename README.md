#AI- powered Healthcare Chatbot


Developed an AI-assisted healthcare chatbot capable of providing preliminary symptom analysis and
health recommendations using NLP and deep learning models in Python.
Used Python libraries (Stream Lit, NumPy, pandas) for data cleaning, feature engineering, and text
preprocessing of medical datasets.
Integrated TensorFlow to build and train custom neural networks for symptom classification and disease
prediction based on user inputs.
